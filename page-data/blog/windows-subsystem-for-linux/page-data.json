About 30 minutes had past\nwhile I aimlessly troubleshot, but ultimately I found myself on Apple‚Äôs support site scheduling an appointment to have my laptop serviced.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>My initial thought after setting up my appointment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Que sera sera! I get a little vacation from technology, wonderful!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It was soon after that thought that another had occured to me; <span>üòÅ</span> which came as quite a surprise <span>üòÅ</span>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What if I come up with an amazing, life altering, idea that required the use of my most familiar working\nenivironment - a terminal (iterm2) and my precious dotfiles (nothing too crazy), git, vim, and maybe a few others.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It was the very next moment when I found myself gazing across the room towards my desk, taking notice to my Windows 10 desktop. The\ndesktop was not used often so it only had a modest amount of dust on it, but its initial and main purpose is to serve\nas a decent gaming rig; now (<strong>NOW‚Ä¶</strong>) though, it had to elevate its purpose to new heights.</p>\n<p>But wait‚Ä¶ its Windows 10, and I favor a Unix-like terminal environment with vim and bash; while this dusty machine could offer me‚Ä¶\nwhat? Notepad and PowerShell.</p>\n<p>Oh, but wait‚Ä¶ I remember some mentions from a couple years back of Windows 10 offering an embedded Ubuntu Linux; perhaps\nthere is some saving grace after all.</p>\n<p>Thus, my journey begun‚Ä¶ and here within this blog, I will detail my findings in hopes that it may bring another\nhope in a similar time of need.</p>\n<h1 id=\"enabling-windows-subsystem-for-linux\">Enabling Windows Subsystem for Linux</h1>\n<h2 id=\"install-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux\">Install the Windows Subsystem for Linux</h2>\n<p>Open PowerShell as an Administrator and run:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"powershell\"><pre class=\"language-powershell\"><code class=\"language-powershell\"><span class=\"token function\">PS</span> C:\\WINDOWS\\system32> <span class=\"token function\">Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-</span>Online <span class=\"token operator\">-</span>FeatureName Microsoft<span class=\"token operator\">-</span>Windows<span class=\"token operator\">-</span>Subsystem<span class=\"token operator\">-</span>Linux</code></pre></div>\n<p>Restart your computer when prompted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"install-your-linux-distribution-of-choice\">Install your Linux Distribution of Choice</h2>\n<p>There are a few choices for installing Linux on your Windows 10 machine:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download and install from the Microsoft Store</li>\n<li>Download and install from the Command-Line/Script</li>\n<li>Download and manually unpack and install (for Windows Server)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I chose the first option - Download and install from the Microsoft Store.</p>\n<p>The list of distributions available to install was quite surprising; to name a few - SUSE, Debian, and Kali Linux\nwere among others on the list.
